# Foodifier

Foodifier Discord bot rewritten in React Native as my first RN project. Written in Typescript and developed using Expo Go.


So what makes it different from the tens of other UCSC menu apps?
## Features
WIP

## TODO

* Add nutrition calculator for calorie count, protein count, and other metrics
* Add notification support for user-chosen food items
* Add busyness indicators through the [waitz](https://waitz.io/ucsc) API

## Running Locally

To automatically install all node module requirements run `cat requirements.txt | xargs npm install -g` 
The app was created using Expo Go.
To run on your phone, run `npx expo start` in the Foodifier folder and scan the QR code or open it through the Expo application.
